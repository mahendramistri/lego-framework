What is Log4j?
Log4j is a brilliant logging API available both on Java and .net framework. Advantages are:
– Log4j allows you to have a very good logging infrastructure without putting in any efforts.
– Log4j gives you the ability to categorize logs at different levels (Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, Error and Fatal).
– Log4j gives you the ability to direct logs to different outputs. For e.g. to a file, Console or a Database.
– Log4j gives you the ability to define the format of output logs.
– Log4j gives you the ability to write Asynchronous logs which helps to increase the performance of the application.
– Loggers in Log4j follow a class hierarchy which may come handy to your applications.

If you are not able to understand any of these points than don’t worry. Things will get clearer as we approach to the end of Log4j Tutorial series.
